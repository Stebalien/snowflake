[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Stebalien/snowflake.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Stebalien/snowflake)

A crate for quickly generating unique IDs with guaranteed properties. This
library is completely unrelated to twitter's snowflake library.

This crate currently includes guaranteed process unique IDs but may include new
ID types in the future.
